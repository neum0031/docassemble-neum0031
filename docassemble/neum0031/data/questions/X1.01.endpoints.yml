  **You do not need to write your contract down to prove you have a contract.**

  Many people think they don't have a contract because they never signed anything.
  However, the law doesn't work that way.  If you and someone else:

  - promised to do some work; and
  - promised to pay for that work

  then you most likely have a contract, even though you never wrote anything down.

  A written contract helps to work out exactly what those promises were, but 
  it's not required in order for there to be a contract.  A written contract
  is evidence of what you promised, but it's not required to prove the
  promises ever existed.

  Based on your responses, 
  you **may be able to sue** for breach of contract.

  You should seek legal advice.  Collect any evidence about the 
  contract that you might have, such as text message, phone call logs,
  diary entries and so-on.

  Based on your responses, you **may not be able to sue** for 
  breach of contract.

  You should still seek legal advice for a formal legal opinion.

  Based on your responses:

  % if MJFsue_reason == 'JJNpromisee':
  % if MJFcertainty != 'MJFagree_exact':
  - You and the other person did not agree to do this work, or all of this work,
    or there was other work done that was not agreed to.
  % endif
  % if not MJFconsideration:
  - You never reached a firm agreement on how much to pay for the work done.
  % endif
  % if not MJFcapacity:
  - The other person was under 18.  It is possible in some circumstances to enter into
    a contract with people under 18.  You should seek legal advice about whether your
    situation meets these circumstances.
  % endif
  % endif

  % if MJFsue_reason == 'JJNpromisor':
  % if MJFcertaintypromisor != 'MJFagree_exact':
  - You and the other person did not agree to do this work, or all of this work,
    or there was other work done that was not agreed to.
  % endif
  % if not MJFconsiderationpromisor:
  - You never reached a firm agreement on how much to pay for the work done.
  % endif
  % if not MJFcapacity:
  - The other person was under 18.  It is possible in some circumstances to enter into
    a contract with people under 18.  You should seek legal advice about whether your
    situation meets these circumstances.
  % endif
  % endif


  In order for there to be a contract, you need to prove these things:

  - That you and the other person agreed to the work to be done.
  - That you and the other person agreed to how much you would pay for the work.
  - That you and the other person are able to enter into a contract.  Usually this means you
    both should be over 18 years old.  You need to seek legal advice if one or both of
    you is under 18.
